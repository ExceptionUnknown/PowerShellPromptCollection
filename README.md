# PowerShell Prompt Collection

This repository contains a collection of customized Prompt functions for Microsoft's PowerShell. 

## Installation + Dependencies

To install, simply add the contents of the file to your Profile.

These Prompts leverage ANSI Escape sequences for colorization, so your mileage may vary on appearance. If it looks bad, and you use Windows Terminal, I suggest making changes to your Color Scheme.

You **WILL** need to have installed [Nerd Fonts by ryanoasis](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) in order for many of these functions (*the ones with 'NF' in the filename*) to display correctly. Otherwise you will end up with a big fat ***?*** instead. **Set your terminal's font to 'Hack Nerd Font' and they will display correctly. Other Nerd Fonts may include all the symbols but they may not.**

## Included in This Collection

* **'Simple Enough'** - A Prompt designed to be exactly what it says on the tin. Nothing too special or flashy, nothing that will cause PowerShell to take forever and a day to load. Just your username, elevation status, and the path to the current directory. 

## Project Goals

* Add support for Nerd Fonts other than Hack

## Risks and Challenges

A risk is that people will not enjoy my Prompt functions. A major challenge is that I may not have the patience to create more than, like, 5 whole Prompts before I get bored of the Project entirely.

## Final Thoughts

I hope you enjoy these Prompts as much as I enjoyed writing them! ***Happy automating!***
